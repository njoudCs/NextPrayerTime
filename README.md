# NextPrayerTime

I am providing this code to help those muslims who want to put the next prayer times on their apps ðŸ•Œ.

The next prayer time calculations are based on the Adhan library.

## UserDefaults

The app uses UserDefaults in order to register default settings that can subsequently be overridden by the end user.
